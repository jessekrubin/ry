# DEVELOPMENT

**OPEN TO PRS!**

## style guide

- **NO UNWRAPPING**
- **NO PANICS**
- **USE CLIPPY** `just clippy` or `just ci`
- **USE RUSTFMT AND RUFF** `just fmt`
- avoid using macros as they are not as easy to reason about and/or debug, but feel free to say 'yolo'
- library style guide:
  - python objects/structs/classes defined in the library should be named either `Py<CLASSNAME>` or `Ry<CLASSNAME>` and
    the prefix should be consistent throughout the library (eg `ryo3-jiff` uses `Ry` as the internal prefix to not
    conflict with the `Py<CLASSNAME>` structs provided by `pyo3`)
  - if a `pyclass` or `pyfunction` is not mirroring a rust function prefer names that are puns but also
    semi-descriptive (eg `Globsters` in `ryo3-globset`)
  - attempt to mirror the structure of the og library as much as possible
  - wrapper libraries should be of the form `ryo3-<LIB_NAME>` where `<LIB_NAME>` is the name of the library they
  - library directories should be `kebab-case` and should be `ryo3-<LIB_NAME>`
  - MUST PROVIDE TYPE ANNOTATIONS

## Creating a new library/wrapper-thing

- copy the template library  `ryo3-quick-maths` library to your new library name
- refer to the above style guide for naming conventions

## tools

### python

- we use `maturin` for building the python wheels
- we support `python-3.9+`
- we use `pytest` for testing as well as the following plugins:
  - `pytest-benchmark`
  - `pytest-asyncio` (may switch to `anyio` in the future)
  - `hypothesis`

### just

**`cargo install just`**

- we use `just` for task running
- to see all tasks run `just` or `just --list` (our default task echos the list of tasks)
