# TODO

- `jiff`
  - [ ] jiff until methods
  - [ ] jiff offset object testing
  - [ ] pydatetime comparisons? I dont know if this is a good idea
  - [ ] rename `Span` to `TimeSpan` in `jiff` module as it is clearer?
  - [ ] MAYBE rename `Zoned` to `ZonedDatetime` in `jiff`?
  - [ ] convert all `jiff` python conversions to use the jiff-new-type pattern
